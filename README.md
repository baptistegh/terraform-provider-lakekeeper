## Docs

All documentation for this provider can be found on the Terraform Registry: https://registry.terraform.io/providers/baptistegh/lakekeeper/latest/docs.

## Installation

This provider can be installed automatically using Terraform >=0.13 by using the `terraform` configuration block:

```terraform
terraform {
  required_providers {
    lakekeeper = {
      source = "baptistegh/lakekeeper"
      version = "<version>"
    }
  }
}
```

## Releases

This provider uses [GoReleaser](https://goreleaser.com/]) to build and publish releases. Each release published to GitHub contains binary files for Linux, macOS (darwin), and Windows, as configured within the [`.goreleaser.yml`](https://github.com/baptistegh/terraform-provider-lakekeeper/blob/main/.goreleaser.yml) file.

Each release also contains a `terraform-provider-lakekeeper_${RELEASE_VERSION}_SHA256SUMS` file that can be used to check integrity.

You can find the list of releases [here](https://github.com/baptistegh/terraform-provider-lakekeeper/releases). You can find the changelog for each version [here](https://github.com/baptistegh/terraform-provider-lakekeeper/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

## Development

This project requires Go 1.24 and Terraform >= 1.9.8.

After cloning the repository, you can build the project by running `make build`

### Local Environment

You can spin up a local developer environment via [Docker Compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/) by running `make testacc-up`. This will spin up a few containers for Lakekeeper, Keycloak, PostgreSQL and OpenFGA, which can be used for testing the provider. This environment and its setup via make local is not intended for production use.

To stop the environment you can use the `make clean`.

### Tests

Every resource supported by this provider will have a reasonable amount of acceptance test coverage.

You can run acceptance tests against a Lakekeeper instance by running `make testacc`.

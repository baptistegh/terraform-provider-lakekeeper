# lakekeeper_warehouse (Data Source)

The `lakekeeper_warehouse` data source retrieves information about a lakekeeper warehouse.

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "lakekeeper_warehouse" "foo" {
  warehouse_id = "116d3ba8-1c38-4548-b39c-aaed6c325406"

Read-Only:

- `expiration_seconds` (Number) When the types is `soft`. Entity will be deleted after `expiration_seconds`. Default is `3600`
- `type` (String) Type of the delete profile. Can be `hard` or `soft`

### Nested Schema for `storage_profile`

Read-Only:

- `account_name` (String) The account name for ADLS storage profile. Required if type is `adls`.
- `allow_alternative_protocols` (Boolean) Allow `s3a://`, `s3n://`, `wasbs://` in locations. This is disabled by default. We do not recommend to use this setting except for migration.
- `assume_role_arn` (String) Optional ARN to assume when accessing the bucket from Lakekeeper for S3 storage profile
- `authority_host` (String) The authority host for ADLS storage profile. Defaults to `https://login.microsoftonline.com`.
- `aws_kms_key_arn` (String) ARN of the KMS key used to encrypt the S3 bucket, if any.
- `bucket` (String) The bucket name for the storage profile. Required if type is `gcs` or `s3`.
- `endpoint` (String) Optional endpoint to use for S3 requests, if not provided the region will be used to determine the endpoint. If both region and endpoint are provided, the endpoint will be used. Example: `http://s3-de.my-domain.com:9000`

- `key_prefix` (String) Subpath in the filesystem to use.
- `path_style_access` (Boolean) Path style access for S3 requests. If the underlying S3 supports both, we recommend to not set path_style_access.

- `region` (String) Region to use for S3 requests. Required if type is `s3`.

- `sts_role_arn` (String)
- `sts_token_validity_seconds` (Number) The validity of the STS tokens in seconds. Default is `3600`.
